**- Game Play -**
START: To begin the game, the player will see 10 cards "face down" on the screen. 

PLAY: When the player clicks a card, it will "flip", displaying either an English word or a Chinese character. The player will then have a chance to click one more card to reveal another word or character. Flipping 2 cards constitutes one turn. If the word and character match, the cards will be removed from the board and displayed on the side. If the word and character do not match, the cards will "flip" back to their original state and the player will have a chance to try again. 

END: The game ends when the board has been cleared of all cards.

**- Scoring -**
The best possible score for the game is the minimum number of turns needed to clear the board (number of cards / 2). The player's score will be calculated based on how many turns they took to clear the board in comparison to the best possible score. The player will be shown some kind of message upon clearing the board reflecting this score.

**- Additional Features -**
1. Allow player to enter their own 10 cards to play with.
2. Allow player to choose from a board of 10 or 20 cards.
3. Allow player to change the color of the cards.
4. Post player's score to a "leaderboard" so they can track their improvement.
