## <div align="center">A Game with a Purpose</div>
As someone who has spent years devoted to the study of foreign languages, I have always been fascinated by the psychology behind learning — and methods for *how* to learn effectively. 

Whether it's a foreign language, a musical instrument, a technical skill or just information you need to know for a test, almost everyone has something they want to learn. And for some, the best way to learn is through play.

I designed **[記憶 Memory](link)** to be a template for a learning tool. My game uses traditional Chinese characters, but this template could be adapted to any subject matter. As long as you're having fun playing the game, the learning will come naturally - you might not even notice it happening!

## <div align="center">Getting Started</div>

Let's play **[記憶 Memory](link)**!

The game begins with a starter deck of miscellaneous beginner cards featuring easy Chinese characters. 

To preview the cards that are in this deck, turn on **Study Mode** by clicking the toggle at the top. You can use this feature on any deck at any time to review the cards — even during game play.

#### *Game Play*

1. Play the game by flipping over two cards at a time until you find a match!

    >Remember, each match is a Chinese character and its meaning — *not two identical cards!*

2. Matches are removed from the board and will display on the **Matches** board to the right.

Once you've gotten a feel for how the game works, check out the other beginner decks, or try an intermediate or advanced deck for an added challenge!

Click on any Chinese character on the *Matches* board to add that word to your own custom study list.

If you want to study your own words that aren't included in the premade decks, you can create your own custom deck with 10 words of your choice!

Once you have entered 10 words, you'll also have the option to choose a color for your deck.

Now you can play with a deck of your own words!
